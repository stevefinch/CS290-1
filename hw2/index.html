			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaporwave is a microgenre of electronic music and an Internet meme that emerged in the early 2010s.[17] The music appropriates 1980s and 1990s styles of mood music such as smooth jazz, elevator music, and lounge music, typically sampling or manipulating tracks via chopped and screwed techniques and other effects. Its surrounding subculture is sometimes associated with an ambiguous or satirical take on consumer capitalism and popular culture, and tends to be characterized by a nostalgic or surrealist engagement with the popular entertainment, technology and advertising of previous decades. It also incorporates early Internet imagery, late 1990s web design, Greco-Roman statues, glitch art, anime, 3D-rendered objects, and cyberpunk tropes in its cover artwork and music videos.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originating as an ironic variant of chillwave,[18] vaporwave was loosely derived from the experimental tendencies of the mid-2000s hypnagogic pop scene. The style was pioneered by producers such as James Ferraro, Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never), and Ramona Xavier (Vektroid).[19] A circle of online producers were particularly inspired by Xavier's Floral Shoppe (December 2011), which established a blueprint for the genre, and the movement subsequently built an audience on sites Last.fm, Reddit, and 4chan while a flood of new acts, many operating under online pseudonyms, turned to Bandcamp for distribution. Following the wider exposure of vaporwave in 2012, a wealth of subgenres and offshoots emerged, such as future funk, mallsoft, and hardvapour.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaporwave originated on the Internet as an ironic variant of chillwave.[18] It was loosely derived from the work of hypnagogic pop artists such as Ariel Pink and James Ferraro, which was characterized by the invocation of retro popular culture,[20] as well as the "analog nostalgia" of the chillwave scene.[6] The style was formulated through the albums Eccojams Vol. 1 (Daniel Lopatin as "Chuck Person", August 2010) and Far Side Virtual (Ferraro, October 2011).[21][12] Eccojams featured chopped and screwed variations on popular 1980s pop songs with album artwork that resembled the packaging of the 1992 video game Ecco the Dolphin. As Lopatin moved on to other ideas, middle-class teens and young adults used Eccojams as a starting point for what would become vaporwave.[5] According to Stereogum's Miles Bowe, vaporwave was more specifically a fusion between Lopatin's "chopped and screwed plunderphonics" and the "nihilistic easy-listening of James Ferraroâ€™s Muzak-hellscapes".[8]
